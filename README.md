Ford Credit Intern Coding Exercise

To run Exercise 1, build the file "ManhattanDistance.java" and run it. Then just follow the instructions given in the console.
To run the Exercise 2 GUI, just build the file "MustangBronco.java" and run it. It should open a Java Swing application which will have the Mustang Bronco application.

There is also JUnit 4 test files for both Exercise 1 and 2 in the "test" folder, which tests some edge cases and regular cases for both.
